## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught frontend developer based in Brisbane, Australia. Currently transitioning from a career in fitness to become a web developer. 
I have had some experience with web development using some fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding during university, so I am picking them up again and being more seriously about becoming a developer.
I'm learning through different online courses/tutorials and bootcamps with a focus on React and building practical web projects.

### ðŸš€ Current Goals 
 - Learn advanced HTML, CSS, Javascript
 - Learn React, Git/GitHub, Databases (MongoDB/SQL), NodeJS
 - Build 5+ real-world projects
 - Land my first frontend developer job in 9 months
